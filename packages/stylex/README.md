# @moneytor/stylex

That package is basically a re-export of everything from StyleX. Since StyleX provides pretty generically named functions is nice to use them scoped to some namespace. That's also pattern spread in the docs, examples etc. However, something about the setup of the packages makes the intellisense of that approach not working by default. Couldn't fix it at all - decided to create this so it creates proper default export and fixes the autocomplete.
